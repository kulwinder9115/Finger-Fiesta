🎉 Finger Fiesta
-
A Webcam-Controlled Game using HTML, CSS, and TensorFlow.js

📌 Overview : 
Finger Fiesta is an interactive browser-based game that uses hand gesture recognition via your webcam to control gameplay. Built with HTML, CSS, and TensorFlow.js, the project demonstrates how machine learning models can be integrated into web applications to create fun, engaging, and innovative experiences.
Instead of relying on keyboard or mouse inputs, players use their fingers and hand gestures to interact with the game — making it both entertaining and a showcase of computer vision in action.

🚀 Features
- 🎮 Webcam-based controls: Play the game using hand gestures detected in real-time.
- 🧠 TensorFlow.js integration: Uses pre-trained models for hand tracking and gesture recognition.
- 🌐 Purely web-based: Runs directly in the browser with no installation required.
- 🎨 Responsive design: Built with HTML and CSS for a clean, user-friendly interface.
- ⚡ Lightweight & fast: Optimized for smooth performance on most modern browsers.
